# BuildYourOwnAdventure

Fundamentals of Github:
If you are changing the project, first create a branch.
After testing and confirming that your changes did not create bugs, merge back into the main branch.
Don't merge if you have not tested and confirmed no bugs.
If someone else needs to work, then they will have to debug their own copy before they can do anything.

Sorry if this is basic lol, I just had someone merge bugs into main a few times last semester.
